# swiftui-practice

Welcome to the **swiftui-practice** repo! This is where I store all the exercises, projects, and examples while learning SwiftUI. This repository tracks my learning progress with various SwiftUI concepts, from basic to advanced techniques.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to practice and master SwiftUI by building small apps, exploring new components, and learning the essential principles of the framework, including:
- Building user interfaces (UI) using SwiftUI components.
- Managing state, data, and interactions in SwiftUI.
- Creating responsive and adaptive UIs for different iOS devices.
- Developing simple and more complex applications to improve iOS development skills.

## Projects in this repo

This repo contains the projects and exercises I’m working on as part of my learning journey. Some examples of what you can find here:
- **Basic Views**: Creating basic UI elements like `Text`, `Image`, `Button`, `VStack`, `HStack`, `List`, etc.
- **State Management**: Handling and updating app state with tools like `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`.
- **Navigation**: Building multi-screen apps with navigation using `NavigationView` and `NavigationLink`.
- **Animations**: Experimenting with basic and advanced animation techniques in SwiftUI.
- **Data Persistence**: Storing and retrieving data with technologies like `UserDefaults`, `CoreData`, and `FileManager`.
